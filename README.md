# BookStoreSystem

This is the final and completed version of the Book Store Management System, initially laid out by Professor Christine Lauredneau with everything being statically allocated.

With the the collaboration of myself and Yin Yeun Leng, the program was converted to become fully dynamically allocated, and also more usable with newer features and a "Checkout System"

For instructions reegarding the program, read the README attached.


Thank you,
